"""What code can decide, code decides. Cheap deterministic checks that run before any model.

- `truncate`: state sent to a decider is trimmed; more text is more noise, not more signal.
- `quote_present`: a quotation that is not in the source is fabricated. No model call.
- `is_repeat`: two queries that share most tokens are the same query. The model only has
