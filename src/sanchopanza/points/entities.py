"""Knowledge-graph hygiene: same entity, fact relation, closed-vocabulary classification.

Measured (paper, G1, G2, G4): entity alignment 24/24 with hard negatives (siblings, similar
nicknames, ruling vs ruling); fact relation 16/20 (not integrated in production until a
larger bench); classification against independent labels 80-85 % over majority baselines
of 43-62 %. Confusions concentrate between adjacent classes.

Classification always adds an `other` option unless told not to. The model cannot abstain
out-of-domain if the list does not let it; the paper's public-bench run measures the
effect of that option (docs/paper.md, Section 5.9).
