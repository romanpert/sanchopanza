"""Model per subtask: how much model does this piece of work deserve?

Measured (paper, D1): 17/20 raw agreement on a 3-level complexity scale; 100 % when acting
at confidence >= 0.75; a small LLM scored 8/20 on the same cases. The complexity question is
a Score, the least reliable primitive in our calibration data, which is why `act` (0.75)
gates the downgrade and why tasks about identifiable people never go to the light tier.
