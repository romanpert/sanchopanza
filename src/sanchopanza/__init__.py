"""Sancho: a calibrated, non-generative decision layer for LLM agent harnesses.

The knight thinks; the squire reads. A System One decision model (TypeSafe's Jev, a local
classifier, an LLM forced into a schema) takes the procedural decisions of an agent loop
(which model, which search, which page, which citation, which command) through the
harness's hooks and tools, with calibrated probabilities, asymmetric thresholds, fail-open
defaults and a journal entry for every decision.

    from sanchopanza.providers import create

    squire = Squire(create("jev"), thresholds=Thresholds())
    tier = await squire.route_task("List the rulings that mention defamation since 2020")
