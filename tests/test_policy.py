    For every Truth answer in every recording in this repository, `confidence` is exactly
    `|2p - 1|`. That is by construction: the Truth wire carries only `noul`, and
    `providers.jev.from_wire` computes the confidence (`contract.truth_confidence`), so the
    recordings could not show anything else. An earlier docstring called this a canary on the
    provider; it cannot fail, and the provider is watched by `from_wire` instead
    (`test_a_truth_confidence_sent_by_the_provider_is_ignored_and_said_once`).

    What stands: on a Truth-driven point, probability and confidence are the same number, and
    asking for both `p >= a` and `confidence >= c` is asking for `p >= max(a, (1 + c) / 2)`.
    That is how `memory_write` came to enforce 0.80 while its configuration said 0.70.
