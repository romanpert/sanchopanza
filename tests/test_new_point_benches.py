"""The new points' bench replayed from its recording, including the finding that hurts.

No network: every decision comes from `fixtures/new-points.jsonl`, a recording of the run
of 2026-09-24. The tests below pin three things on purpose:

1. the headline agreement per point, so a change to a question or a policy has to be
   deliberate and show up as a failing test;
2. **the gap between what the model orders correctly and what the shipped thresholds act
   on**, which is the real finding of that run and the thing a future tuning pass has to
   beat;
3. that every error the policy makes is a refusal to act rather than a wrong action.

If the benches or the fixture are absent the module is skipped, as the public one is.
