"""Derive a threshold to a target precision, the way a deployed system does it.

    python benchmarks/thresholds.py --derive docs/results/A --eval docs/results/B

Free: it reads two bench result files and does arithmetic. Nothing is called.

Why this exists. Thresholds are set the way Google sets them: fifty cases and a second
annotator per new point, then per point, to a target precision, reported as recall@X
[Frommgen et al., 2024] (`docs/paper.md` Section 5.10). This is that, plus the part the promise left
out: **whether the sample is large enough for the target to mean anything.**

Two rules make the difference between deriving a threshold and fitting one to its own score:

1. **Derive on one set, report on another.** The threshold is chosen using only `--derive`
   and every number reported comes from `--eval`. A threshold picked and scored on the same
   cases will always look good and predicts nothing.
2. **Require the LOWER BOUND of precision to meet the target, not the point estimate.** With
   a dozen acted cases, an observed precision of 100 % has a 95 % Wilson lower bound near
   68 %. Choosing "the least strict threshold whose observed precision reaches the target"
   therefore picks an extreme that does not survive contact with new data - we tried it, and
   it produced thresholds of 0.13 and 0.23 that missed their own target out of sample by up
   to 16 points. Requiring the lower bound is what turns "target precision" into a claim that
   can fail.

The consequence is a sample-size floor that is pure arithmetic, and it is the useful output
of this file. With perfect observed precision, the number of ACTED cases needed for the 95 %
Wilson lower bound to clear a target is:

| Target | Acted cases needed | Labelled cases per point, at a balanced label mix |
|---|---|---|
| 80 % | 16 | about 32 |
| 90 % | 35 | about 70 |
| 95 % | 73 | about 146 |

So fifty cases per point supports an 80 % precision target and nothing above it. Raising a
threshold to a 90 % target is not a labelling afternoon; it is 70 cases per point.
