"""Agreement between the two annotators and the evaluator.

    python benchmarks/agreement.py --results docs/results/2026-09-24-fifty --benches benches

Free: it reads files and counts. Nothing is called.

Annotator 1 is the author, whose labels are the `expected` field of the bench files.
Annotator 2 is a separate generative model, whose labels are `annotator-2.jsonl` in the
results directory, produced blind to both the first label and the evaluator's answer.

Two annotators, one of them a model, is **not** the two independent humans the literature
assumes when it reports an inter-annotator agreement, and the number below should never be
quoted as though it were. It cannot see a criterion that is wrong in the same way for the
model and for the author who wrote that criterion in the model's idiom. What it can see, and
what it is for, is a case whose label depends on the annotator rather than on the criteria.

The last two lines are the ones worth reading: the evaluator's agreement where the two
annotators agree, against its agreement where they do not. A point whose errors cluster on
the cases humans would argue about is a point with an ambiguous question, not a bad model.
