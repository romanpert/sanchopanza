"""The second annotator: another model, blind, over the bench cases.

    python benchmarks/annotate.py --benches loop-b.jsonl memory-b.jsonl \
        --out docs/results/2026-09-24-fifty --model claude-opus-5

Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Every call is metered and the bill is written next to the labels,
which is the whole reason this file exists rather than a script in somebody's scratchpad: the
first run of this annotator, on 2026-09-24, produced 212 labels and **no measured cost**,
because there was nothing to reach for and nobody noticed until afterwards.

What it is. Annotator 1 is the author, whose labels are the `expected` field of the bench
files. This is annotator 2: a generative model given the same question and the same criteria
the evaluator receives - rendered from the package's own question builders, so it answers the
literal question and not a paraphrase - and blind to both the author's label and the
evaluator's answer. It sees one case per request, so cases cannot contaminate each other.

What it is not. Two annotators, one of them a model, is not two independent humans. It cannot
see a criterion that is wrong in the same way for a model and for the author who wrote that
criterion in a model's idiom. `benchmarks/agreement.py` says the same where it reports kappa.

Re-running over an existing `annotator-2.jsonl` prints a stability report instead of silently
overwriting it: same cases, same prompts, a second sample. A label that moves between runs is
a label the bench should not be counting either way.

One measured note on cost, because it is the opposite of the intuition. Nothing here caches:
each case is its own request of a few hundred tokens, and the minimum cacheable prefix is 512
to 4096 tokens depending on the model, so there is no prefix long enough to cache. A
breakpoint on the system prompt was tried and read zero. That is the asymmetry the package is
about, seen from the other side: the expensive model earns its keep from a long shared
context, and a per-decision judgment has no long shared context to earn it from - which is
also why the same judgments cost 28.3 millionths each when a calibrated evaluator makes them
and about a hundred times that when a generative model does.
