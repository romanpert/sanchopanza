"""The same judgments, made two ways: what substitution actually buys.

    python benchmarks/substitution.py --results docs/results/2026-09-24-fifty

Free: it reads artefacts already on disk. Nothing is called.

This is the claim the package exists for, and the only one of the three economies in
`docs/where-it-pays.md` whose arithmetic is safe: a cheap calibrated decision pays when it
**replaces a call a bigger model was going to make anyway**. Everything else in this
repository - page triage, redundancy, context pruning - is avoidance, and avoidance measured
null twice.

The comparison here is unusually clean, and it fell out of doing something else. The second
annotator of `benchmarks/annotate.py` is a frontier generative model asked, one case per
request, **the same questions from the same question builders** that the evaluator is asked,
over the same bench cases. So the two artefacts in a results directory are two independent
answers to one set of judgments:

  - `results.json`       the evaluator's answer, its cost and its latency
  - `annotator-2.jsonl`  the generative model's answer
  - `annotator-usage.json` what that generative model cost and how long it took

Accuracy is measured the same way for both: agreement with the bench's `expected` labels,
which neither of them saw. That is the part that makes the price ratio mean something - a
cheaper answer that is worse is not a saving, it is a discount on a different product.

Two honest notes about what the ratio is not. The generative model here is run at `low`
effort with a one-word answer, so it is close to the cheapest a frontier model can be asked
to do this; and it caches nothing, because a per-decision prompt of a few hundred tokens is
below the minimum cacheable prefix. Both facts push the comparison *towards* the generative
model, not away from it.
